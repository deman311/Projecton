Job Interview Project

### Day ðŸ¥‡ 29/03/22
So the things I did today were to read about ONNX, search for suitable datasets for my model, read some CNN notebooks to refresh my memory about CNN's,
then I took inspiration from dog-cat Kaggle competition notebooks and finally started writing the model.

Lots of training and retraining, tweaking parameters, testing basic stuff - mostly to refresh memory.

End result of the day:
